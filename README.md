# Project ironica

## Background

The project was inspired by the famous *playgrounds* application of iOS/MacOS but also *Karel The Robot*. Both programs illustrate a simple teaching environment for imperative programming basics while the first also integrates a full language runtime (in Swift) into the environment.

The idea was first implemented by creating my own DSL using ANTLR 4.9. Later, I have decided to switch to using Kotlin DSL solely.

## What's difference?

The implementation takes full advantages of Kotlin DSL. By the way, it's based on a client-server structure, which means that the server and client are implemented independently. In theory, you can switch from different implementations of server but also client, although currently there is only one client and only one server.

## Getting Started

## Language reference

The language used in this project is a Kotlin DSL, which is entirely a subset of the language Kotlin.

Get [here](https://play.kotlinlang.org/) for more information about the Kotlin Language.

We will only illustrate the commands and features that might be useful in this project.
